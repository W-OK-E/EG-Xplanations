# EG-Xplanations

In my initial weeks as a college student, I have seen a lot of my friends struggle with Engineering Graphics/Drawing which involves drawing a 2-d projection of a 3-d scenario. So this repo is an attempt to compile Manim-ated(Animations made using the amazing library- Manim) explanations for the problems in the subect. 

Colab notebook references are also given in case you want to play with the Code Directly.
